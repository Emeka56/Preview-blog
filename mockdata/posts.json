      "content": "Maintaining good eye health requires more than just regular checkups. It's essential to practice proper screen habits, wear protective eyewear when needed, and consume a diet rich in vitamins A, C, and E. These steps help reduce strain and prevent long-term damage to your vision. To build stronger daily habits, try the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to relax your focusing muscles. Keep screens slightly below eye level and at arm’s length to reduce glare and dryness. Consistent hydration supports tear production, especially in air-conditioned or dusty environments. Include lutein and zeaxanthin sources like spinach and kale, plus omega-3s from fish to support the retina. Wear sunglasses with UV400 protection outdoors to guard against cataracts and macular damage, and consider blue-light filtering lenses if you spend long hours on screens. Use adequate ambient lighting; avoid reading in the dark or harsh overhead light. Clean contacts properly and replace them as recommended to prevent irritation and infections. Gentle eyelid hygiene, like warm compresses, can help if you experience dryness. Regular movement and cardiovascular exercise improve blood flow to ocular tissues. Aim for consistent sleep so the eyes recover from daily strain. Small, steady habits layered together create a dependable foundation for lifelong vision protection.",

      "tags": ["education", "awareness"],
      "image": "/assets/health-2.jpg",
      "content": "Understanding the anatomy of the human eye is essential for recognizing symptoms of vision problems early. The eye is a complex organ composed of the cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve. Each part plays a vital role in capturing and processing visual information. The cornea provides the first refractive surface, and the lens refines focus for near and far vision. The iris regulates light entry, and the pupil responds to changes in brightness. In the retina, rods support low-light vision and cones support color and detail. Signals pass through the optic nerve to visual centers in the brain for interpretation. When any link in this chain is affected, clarity or field of vision can change. Clouding of the lens (cataracts) blurs images; pressure-related damage (glaucoma) affects peripheral vision; macular changes reduce central detail. Becoming familiar with common signs—persistent blur, glare sensitivity, sudden floaters, or narrow field—encourages timely evaluation. Education equips people to notice changes, seek care, and adopt preventive practices early, supporting long-term visual function.",
